Load fieldbook
::::::::::::::
    | 1. First you have to open an existing Coordinate list or create a new
    | one from the menu. Otherwise coordinates in the filedbook will be lost.

    | 2. After save Coordinate list shape file, will open an empty table. This table stores coordinate points.
        :point_id:    point number
        :e:           East coordinate
        :n:           North coordinate
        :z:           Z coordinate (height)
        :pc:          point code
        :pt:

    | 3. Click the Load fieldbook icon.
    | 4. Choose the type of fieldbook (Leica GSI; Geodimeter JOB/ARE; Sokkia CRD)

JOB/ARE fieldbook open
++++++++++++++++++++++
    | 1. Select your measurments contain .JOB file.

    | 3. After the save, will open a new table in Layers. This attribute table stores measurments.
    |    Id:          identification
    |    Point_id:    point number
    |    Hz:          horizontal angle
    |    V:           vertical angle
    |    Sd:          slope distance
    |    Th:          target height
    |    Pc:          point code
    |    Station:     the point is station or not

    | 4. After the .JOB loading, you have to open the .ARE file.
    | 5. Open the Load fieldbook again, and select your coordinate points contain .JOB file.
    | 6. Save .ARE as .dbf file.
    | 7. After the save, will load into the empty coordinate layer (coordinate shape file).
