Hardware and software requirements
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The SurveyingCalculation plug-in can be used on any computer on which QGIS 
can run. It was tested on Windows 7 and Fedora Linux, but on any other Windows 
versions or Linux distros is should work.

SurveyingCalculation plugin install
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Installing from GitHub**

If you have Git Client (Git Bash or other clients)

#. git clone from https://github.com/zsiki/ls to *~/.qgis2/python/plugins/SurveyingCalculation* (~ is your home directory on Linux, replace it on Windows)
#. Open QGIS Desktop.

If you don't have Git Clone

#. Download the ZIP file from https://github.com/zsiki/ls to your computer.
#. Unzip to *~/.qgis2/python/plugins/SurveyingCalculation*.
#. Open QGIS Desktop.

**Installing from QGIS Plug-in repo**

#. Start QGIS
#. In the the plug-in dialog enable experiental plugins
#. Look for SurveyingCalculation plug-in and press Install button

After installing the plug-in you must enable it in the *Manage and Install 
Plugins* dialog. After it the menu and the toolbar of the plug-in
will be visible.

In case of problem, check the plugin in Manage and Install Plugins dialog.

Beside installing the plug-in you must also install gama-local (part of the GNU
Gama project) for adjustment calculation. See: https://www.gnu.org/software/gama

Settings before use
:::::::::::::::::::

Set to empty string the *Representation for NULL values* on the Data sources
tab in the Setting/Options menu. It makes the Attribute Table (Fieldbook) more
readable.

   *(5.) Settings of Attribute Table*

Open an existing QGIS project which contains a coordinate list (a point shape
file which name must stat with 'coord\_') or create a new project and add an
existing coordinate list to the project or create a new project and create 
a new coordinate list from the *Surveying Calculation* menu.

Check the coordinate reference system (CRS) of your coordinate list (layer
properties from the popup menu of the layer) and the map.

After loading an existing or creating a new Coordinate list shape file, you get
an empty table in your project with the following columns (column names and 
types are mandatory):
        :point_id:    point number
        :e:           East coordinate
        :n:           North coordinate
        :z:           Z coordinate (elevation)
        :pc:          point code
        :pt:          point type

Only one coordinate list should be open in a project.

Loading fieldbooks
::::::::::::::::::

Any number of electric fieldbooks can be opened/loaded into a QGIS project.
You can even create a new empty fieldbook and fill it manually.

#. There must be az open coordinate list in your actual project (a point layer which name starts with coord\_). Otherwise coordinates read from the filedbook will be lost
#. Click on the Load fieldbook icon or select it from the menu
#. Choose the type of fieldbook (`Geodimeter JOB/ARE`_; `Leica GSI`_; `Sokkia CRD`_)

The loader adds an extra column to the observations, the id column, sorting the
table by this column gives the right order of observations.

You can create an empty fieldbook for manual input using the *Create fieldbook*
menu.

Geodimeter JOB/ARE
++++++++++++++++++

#. Select the JOB file
#. Select the output DBF file where your observations will be stored, the name will start with *fb_*, the program will add it to the name automatically you forget
#. After giving the path to the DBF file a new fieldbook is added to your QGIS project. The name of the fieldbook always starts with "fb\_". This database table stores measurements only, it has no graphical (map) data. Fields in the table:
        :id:          ordinal number of observation in fieldbook, sort by this field normally
        :point_id:    point number (max 20 characters)
        :station:     if record data belongs to a station it must be *station* otherwise empty
        :hz:          horizontal angle or orientation angle in station record
        :v:           vertical angle
        :sd:          slope distance
        :th:          target height or instrument height in station record
        :pc:          point code
#. After loading the .JOB, you can optionally load an .ARE file in the same way

Leica GSI
+++++++++

Both the 8 byte and 16 byte GSI files are supported. As there is no standard
markers for station data in GSI files, you can use code block to mark a new
station in observations or you must have a record with station coordinates or
instrument height.

See Job loading.

Sokkia CRD

Using fieldbook data
::::::::::::::::::::

Angles are displayed in the fieldbook in Grads (Gon) unit with four decimals.
Distances, instrument and target heights are in meters.

Sort the fieldbook by the id column, to have the right order of observations

Single Point Calculations
:::::::::::::::::::::::::

In the single calculation dialog you can calculate coordinates of single points
using trigonometric formulas.

Orientation
+++++++++++
#. Click the Single Point Calculations icon.
#. Select the Orientation from the type of Calculations.
#. Select the Station from the list. You can calculate only the orientation of one station at a time.
#. The Target Points list loads automatically.
#. Add to Used Points list one or more points which ypu would like to use for the orientation. If you would like to change the *Used Points* list, use the Remove button.
#. Click the Calculate button.
#. Result of Calculation displayed automatically in result window.
#. You can change settings in the dialog and press calculate to make another calculation, use the Reset button to reset the dialog to its original state.

#. Click the Calculate button.
#. Result of Calculation prints automatically in result window.
#. You can change settings in the dialog and press calculate to make another calculation, use the Reset button to reset the dialog to its original state.
